This file briefly explains the main concepts covered in this directory.

## What is a Web Framework?
A web framework is a software framework designed to simplify the process of building web applications. It provides a structured way to organize your code and includes libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management.

## Building a Web Framework with Flask
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python. To build a web application with Flask, you start by installing Flask using pip, create a new Flask web server, and define routes to render the web pages.

## What is a Route?
A route is a URL pattern that is used to load and display a web page. In Flask, a route is associated with a Python function and the output of that function is sent to the client as a HTML response.

## Defining Routes in Flask
Routes in Flask are defined using the `@app.route()` decorator above a function. The function defines what should be displayed on the web page for that route.

## Handling Variables in a Route
Variables in a Flask route are defined using angle brackets `<variable>`. The variable is then passed as a parameter to the route's function.

## What is a Template?
A template is a file that serves as a starting point for a new document. In Flask, templates (usually HTML files) are used to generate dynamic web pages on the server before sending them to the client.

## Creating a HTML Response in Flask Using a Template
In Flask, you can use the `render_template()` function to generate a HTML response from a template. You pass the name of the template and the variables you want to pass to the template as keyword arguments.

## Creating a Dynamic Template
Dynamic templates in Flask are created using the Jinja2 templating language, which allows for loops and conditionals in templates. Variables passed from Flask to the template can be used within these structures.

## Displaying Data from a MySQL Database in HTML
To display data from a MySQL database in HTML, you first need to fetch the data in your Flask route. Then, pass the data to your template and use it to populate the HTML structure.
